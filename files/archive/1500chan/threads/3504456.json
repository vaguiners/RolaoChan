  "''June 29th.\r\nI gotta get in shape now. Too much sitting is ruining my body, too much abuse has been going on for too long.\r\nFrom now on, it will be 50 push-ups each morning, 50 pull-ups.\r\nThere will be no more pills, there will be no more bad food, no more destroyers of my body.\r\nFrom now on, it will be total organization.\r\nEvery muscle must be tight.''"
