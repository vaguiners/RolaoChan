  "Vai lá attwhorar no 4chan.\r\n\r\n''Maure is facing 34 charges after an investigation by the RCMP’s Alberta-based Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET). Police say their search turned up seven prohibited weapons including loaded assault-style rifles and materials for making explosives.\r\n\r\nMaure was allegedly part of an online community that INSET began monitoring in September 2020. The following January, while under surveillance, police say Maure made posts which “displayed escalating behaviour” which led police to deem him a “threat to critical infrastructure, the police and the public.”\r\n\r\nMaure was arrested with the help of an RCMP tactical team on Feb. 13, 2021, after an hours-long operation outside the Parkland County home where he lived with a family member. The arrest came one day after Maure allegedly damaged a propane tank and shed at an oil and gas facility near Drayton Valley. Investigators say they recovered “numerous” guns during a search of Maure’s property, including three AK-style rifles, an SKS rifle, a 9 mm pistol and high-capacity magazines — as well as police and military paraphernalia.''",
