 I am a man who walks alone \r\n And when I'm walking in a dark road \r\n At night or strolling through the park \r\n \r\n When the light begins to change \r\n I sometimes feel a little strange \r\n A little anxious when it's dark \r\n \r\n Fear of the dark, fear of the dark \r\n I have a constant fear that something's always near \r\n Fear of the dark, fear of the dark \r\n I have a phobia that someone's always there
 Quem roubou quem?
