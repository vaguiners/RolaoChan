 Your affection \r\n Your affection \r\n Taking pride from fear \r\n Past will tell you when to make yourself a hero
 O vazio que deus criou \r\n Tornou a existência detestável \r\n De tudo o que homem produziu \r\n Essa noite só me prestou o álcool
 White shirt, now red my bloody nose \r\n Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes \r\n Creeping around like no one knows \r\n Think you're so criminal.
 Mother, you had me but I never had you \r\n I wanted you, \r\n You didn't want me \r\n So I, I just got to tell you \r\n Goodbye goodbye
 Vater, nimm mich in die Arme \r\n Zeig mir den Weg \r\n Bring mich nach Haus \r\n \r\n Vater, bitte hab Erbarmen \r\n Erhör mein Gebet \r\n Führ mich hier raus
