 https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/florida-abortion-statistics-debunk-common-pro-choice-argument/ \r\n \r\n A 2004 survey by the pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute confirms what Florida’s data suggest, finding that just 4 percent of women who obtained abortions reported a physical-health problem, 3 percent cited possible fetal-health problems, and fewer than .5 percent were pregnant as the result of having been raped. The most common reasons women cited for obtaining an abortion were not being ready for a child or another child, or being unable to afford a child. \r\n \r\n http://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/TrimesterByReason_2018.pdf \r\n https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf 
 Nossa! Mas e daí?
 Catálogo.
 Nada de novo sob o sol, anão.
 A melhor maneira pra não termos mais abortos é colocando os machos na castidade.
