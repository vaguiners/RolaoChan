 >As a piece of literature, the Aeneid has both the strength and weaknesses of its author and subject matter. Vergil was a weakling, usually in poor health, shy to the point of painfulness, a sentimental idealist, and little acquainted with the hard and practical ways of the stern old Roman world. He was never married and seems to have cared little or nothing for feminine society. His one great ideal of life can be summed up in the word pietas, devotion, loyalty, and he equips his hero Aeneas (pius Aeneas) with a full and overflowing measure of this quality, which finds its best expression in an unquestioned obedience to the will of the gods and to their more or less contradictory commands, no matter how much human suffering may be entailed nor how much apparent wrong may result. Vergil was born in Cisalpine Gaul, probably ineligible for Roman citizenship in his early years and possibly a member of a conquered tribe which had felt the pitiless heel of the conqueror. In any case he seems to have early developed a deep sympathy for the oppressed and for the losers in life's battle, and also a profound conviction of the sadness and sorrow of human existence and the futility of human effort in its attempts to adjust its feeble struggles to a world that is too much for it. The craving for satisfaction of a thwarted nature found its chief expression in its reliance upon the gods and their inscrutable ways as they worked out their plans for the world. In addition, he found refuge in a deep reverence for the past with its great heroes who had been so submissive to the will of the gods that they had become but puppets in carrying out the divine commands. \r\n Um verdadeiro anão.
