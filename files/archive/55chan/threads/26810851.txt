 Rivotri​l: Os jude​us são controlados pela Igreja Católica.
 Aproveitando o parênquima paliçádico, o baseado Papa Emérito Bento XVI fez uma defesa do tradicionalismo e criticou o Concílio Vaticano II. \r\n \r\n Benedict XVI breaks silence and publish a letter. \r\n \r\n 'Until the Second Vatican Council, Catholic moral theology was largely founded on natural law, while Sacred Scripture was only cited for background or substantiation. In the Council’s struggle for a new understanding of Revelation, the natural law option was largely abandoned, and a moral theology based entirely on the Bible was demanded. \r\n (…) \r\n Father Schüller was then sent to America for further studies and came back with the realization that from the Bible alone morality could not be expressed systematically. He then attempted a more pragmatic moral theology, without being able to provide an answer to the crisis of morality. \r\n \r\n In the end, it was chiefly the hypothesis that morality was to be exclusively determined by the purposes of human action that prevailed. (…) Consequently, there could no longer be anything that constituted an absolute good, any more than anything fundamentally evil; [there could be] only relative value judgments. There no longer was the [absolute] good, but only the relatively better, contingent on the moment and on circumstances.' \r\n \r\n (…) \r\n \r\n As the criteria for the selection and appointment of bishops had also been changed after the Second Vatican Council, the relationship of bishops to their seminaries was very different, too. Above all, a criterion for the appointment of new bishops was now their “conciliarity,” which of course could be understood to mean rather different things. \r\n \r\n Indeed, in many parts of the Church, conciliar attitudes were understood to mean having a critical or negative attitude towards the hitherto existing tradition, which was now to be replaced by a new, radically open relationship with the world.' \r\n \r\n https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/full-text-pope-emeritus-benedict-xvi-lays-out-thoughts-on-abuse-crisis

Existem bilionárias campanhas de difamação. \r\n A única coisa que foi feita pela sonserina foi querer trazer um catolicismo sionista, que é herético. \r\n \r\n Conde, Terça Livre, e etc. todos estão levando as pessoas pro lado das sombras.
