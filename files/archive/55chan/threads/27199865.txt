 >ἄνθρωπος \r\n >anthropos \r\n >before a vowel, anthrop-, word-forming element meaning 'pertaining to man or human beings,' from comb. form of Greek anthropos 'man, human being' (sometimes also including women) from Attic andra (genitive andros), from Greek aner 'man' (as opposed to a woman, a god, or a boy), from PIE *hner 'man' (cf. Sanskrit nar-, Armenian ayr, Welsh ner). \r\n >Anthropos sometimes is explained as a compound of aner and ops (genitive opos) 'eye, face;' so literally 'he who has the face of a man.' The change of -d- to -th- is difficult to explain; perhaps it is from some lost dialectal variant, or the mistaken belief that there was an aspiration sign over the vowel in the second element (as though *-dhropo-), which mistake might have come about by influence of common verbs such as horao 'to see.' \r\n Os gregos, quando queriam falar de toda a humanidade, usavam esta palavra, que traduziam sempre por Homem. Agora, no mundo hodierno, traduzem-na para humanidade. Perde grandemente o significado.

 >>27199919 \r\n Está errado. \r\n >First attested in Mycenaean Greek 𐀀𐀵𐀫𐀦 (a-to-ro-qo), of uncertain origin. Scholars used to consider it to be a compound from ἀνήρ (anḗr, “man”) and ὤψ (ṓps, “face, appearance, look”): thus, 'he who looks like a man'. However, a δ (d) would be expected to develop by epenthesis, as in the genitive ἀνδρός (andrós), yielding *ἀνδρωπος (*andrōpos). Rosén defends this etymology, positing that the original laryngeal *h₃ in the root for ὤψ (ṓps) (from Proto-Indo-European *h₃ókʷs) changed the δ to its aspirated counterpart θ even across the intervening ρ.[1] \r\n \r\n https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek 
 >>27200007 \r\n >Plato's Cratylus argues that an, 'α,' was dropped from the root, 'ἀναθρεῖ,' in an ancient dialect due to a change in attic pronunciation. It is then concluded that the root word is, 'ἀναθρεῖ (look up at).' In the text it is argued that the distinction between men and all other animals is drawn by man's unique capacity and propensity to inquire.[4]
