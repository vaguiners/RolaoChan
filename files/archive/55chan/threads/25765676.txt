 NT: Treinamos o nosso inglês e os anões rateiam. \r\n \r\n Texto: \r\n \r\n Research at the University of San Diego has revealed that employees in a ‘green’ building are more productive than people who work in a standard building. \r\n \r\n Of course, a ‘green’ building is not just painted green: it is built and maintained with attention to its environmental impact. \r\n \r\n The presence of green plants in an office is known to lower stress levels. \r\n \r\n Other studies show that the colour green also has a positive impact on work. \r\n \r\n Last year, German researchers found that just looking at a green rectangle for a couple of seconds boosts your creative output by 20%. \r\n \r\n Green has strong associations with nature and growth and bringing the outdoors in can make people more relaxed. \r\n \r\n So, if you want to increase productivity in your workplace, go green. 
 Fuck off, faggot.
