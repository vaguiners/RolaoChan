 Não fui eu quem criou o tópico ontem, mas achei a proposta interessante, então vamos lá. O /mu/ está com um projeto para cantarmos juntos a música We Are the World, e para você participar é muito simples. \r\n \r\n >escolha alguma parte/ cantor da música que ainda não foi escolhida \r\n >grave o verso que você escolheu e o refrão \r\n >poste no tópico do /mu/ ( https://55chan.org/mu/res/29993.html ) com o nome do artista que você escolheu para cantar \r\n \r\n Eu tentei encaixar os versos de maneira porca apenas para os anões verem como seria o projeto, se tiver algum anão que manje mais de produção musical, aparece no tópico. \r\n \r\n Aqui está a letra, os cantores que já foram escolhidos foram esses: Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, Kenny Rogers, Al Jarreau, Bob Dylan. \r\n \r\n Lionel Richie: There comes a time when we heed a certain call \r\n Lionel Richie/Stevie
