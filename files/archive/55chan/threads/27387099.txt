 ABSTRACT \r\n \r\n Rapid evolutionary responses to insecticide resistance management interventions by the German cockroach (Blattella germanica L.) \r\n \r\n Mahsa Fardisi, Ameya D.Gondhalekar, Aaron R. Ashbrook & \r\n Michael E. Scharf \r\n \r\n The German cockroach (Blattella germanica L.) is a worldwide pest that lives exclusively in human environments. B. germanica threatens human health by producing asthma-triggering allergens, vectoring pathogenic/antibiotic-resistant microbes, and by contributing to unhealthy indoor environments. While insecticides are essential for reducing cockroach populations and improving health outcomes, insecticide resistance has been a consistent barrier to cockroach control since the 1950s. We conducted seminal field studies to compare three insecticide resistance intervention strategies for cockroaches and evaluated resistance evolution across multiple generations. Using pre-treatment resistance assessment to drive decisions, we found that single active ingredient (AI) treatments can successfully eliminate cockroaches if low starting resistance levels are present. We further established that rotation treatments intuitively reduce selection pressure, and are effective when insecticides with no/low resistance are used. We also found that mixture products containing thiamethoxam+λ-cyhalothrin AIs were universally ineffective and highly repellent; and finally, evolution of cross-resistance among AIs is a significant, previously unrealized challenge.

 É nisso que dá confiar na soja e não esmagar essas porras com chinelo.
