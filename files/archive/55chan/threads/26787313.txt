 A civilização ocidental não precisa do cristianismo. A civilização ocidental FAZ PARTE do cristianismo. A partir do momento em que se retira a Igreja do imaginário, a civilização já acabou. \r\n \r\n Claro que não estou contanto com os protestantes, eles são parte do problema.

 Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844 Oct 15 - 1900 Aug 25, was a German philosopher who challenged the foundations of morality and promoted life affirmation and individualism. He was one of the first existentialist philosophers. Some of Nietzsche's philosophies have surfaced as those upheld by Satanists. \r\n \r\n “A professor of Greek at Basel at the age of twenty-five, Nietzsche abandoned philology and, influenced by the ideas of Schopenhauer (1788-1860), he attempted to develop a critique of traditional religious and philosophical thought. Deteriorating health and growing insanity after 1889 brought him under the control of his sister, Elizabeth, who edited and distorted his writings. \r\n \r\n Nietzsche's complex and ambitious work stressed the important of will, especially the 'will to power', and anticipated modern existentialism in emphasizing that people create their own world and make their own values - 'God is dead'. A fierce critic of Christianity and an opponent of egalitarianism and nationalism, his ideas have influenced ANARCHISM and FEMINISM as well as fascism. Nietzsche's best known writings include Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-4), Beyond Good and Evil (1886) and On the Genealogy of Morals (1887).” \r\n 'Political Ideologies' by Andrew Heywood (2003)1
 >>26787363 \r\n 25 anos, Faço 26 esse ano. Cristianismo é religião de corno, pura tourobosta autoflagelante, coisa de vagabunda, de puta que gosta de leitada na cara, de virar vela em bukkake com teutões. Coisa de cadelinha.

 Friedrich Nietzsche Quotes Quotations : CHRISTIANITY \r\n The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. \r\n Beyond Good and Evil, Chapter 3, the Religious Nature, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live - this very difficulty being necessary. \r\n Beyond Good and Evil, Chapter 3, the Religious Nature, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love, prevents the Christians of today - burning us. \r\n Beyond Good and Evil, Chapter 4, Maxims and Interludes, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Just look at the faces of the great Christians! They are the faces of great haters. \r\n Daybreak, Book 4 351-422, Friedrich Nietzsche \r\n Christianity has a hunter’s instinct for finding out all those who by one means or another may be driven to despair –although only a part of mankind is capable of such despair. Christianity lies in wait for such as those and pursues them \r\n Daybreak, The Broken-Hearted Ones, Friedrich Nietzsche \r\n However unchristian it may seem, I do not even bear any ill feeling towards myself. \r\n Ecce Homo, Why I am So Wise, Friedrich Nietzsche \r\n If that glad message of your Bible were written in your faces, you would not need to demand belief in the authority of that book in such stiff-necked fashion. \r\n Human, All-Too-Human : Miscellaneous Maxims and Opinions, 98. THEATRICALITY AND HONESTY OF UNBELIEVERS, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n When on a Sunday morning we hear the old bells ring out, we ask ourselves, “Is it possible!

CHRISTIANITY AS ANTIQUITY, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote

 If Christianity were right, with its theories of an avenging God, of general sinfulness, of redemption, and the danger of eternal damnation, it would be a sign of weak intellect and lack of character not to become a priest, apostle or hermit, and to work only with fear and trembling for one's own salvation; it would be senseless thus to neglect eternal benefits for temporary comfort. Taking it for granted that there is belief, the commonplace Christian is a miserable figure, a man that really cannot add two and two together, and who, moreover, just because of his mental incapacity for responsibility, did not deserve to be so severely punished as Christianity has decreed. \r\n Human, All-Too-Human : Part One, 116. THE COMMONPLACE CHRISTIAN, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of contact with actuality. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 15, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Buddhism is a hundred times as realistic as Christianity it is part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of philosophical speculation. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 20, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent : it is indecent to be a Christian today. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 38, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n The very word 'Christianity' is a misunderstanding at bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 39, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n For this remains as I have already pointed out the essential difference between the two religions of decadence : Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises everything, but fulfils nothing. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 42, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Principle of 'Christian love': it insists upon being well paid in the end. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 45, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n One cannot read the New Testament without acquired admiration for whatever it abuses not to speak of the 'wisdom of this world,' which an impudent wind bag tries to dispose of 'by the foolishness of preaching.' \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 46, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of antagonism to all the self preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 5, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n If Islam despises Christianity, it has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with men. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 59, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Christianity, alcohol the two great means of corruption. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 60, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough, I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race. \r\n The AntiChrist, Chapter 62, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n The Christian resolve to find the world ugly and bad, has made the world ugly and bad. \r\n The Gay Science : Third Book, 130. A Dangerous Resolution, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Buddha says: 'Do not flatter your benefactor!'. Let one repeat this saying in a Christian church : it immediately purifies the air of everything Christian. \r\n The Gay Science : Third Book, 142. Frankincense, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n They would have to sing better songs for me to believe in their Saviour: his disciples would have to look more redeemed! \r\n Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Priests, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n It was Christianity, with its heartfelt resentment against life, that first made something unclean of sexuality: it threw filth on the origin, on the essential fact of our life. \r\n Twighlight of the Idols, What I Owe to the Ancients, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n Christianity is religion for the executioner. \r\n Twighlight of the Idols, The Four Great Errors, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote \r\n But this people has deliberately made itself stupid, for nearly a millennium: nowhere have the two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity, been abused more dissolutely. \r\n Twighlight of the Idols, What the Germans Lack, Friedrich Nietzsche Go to Quote

 O cineasta ateu (seguidor da filosofia de Nietzsche) Andrés Baiz, diretor do filme 'Satan', comentou uma vez sobre o conceito do superior (Superman), que ensinou Nietzsche \r\n 'Satanás é o super-homem de Nietzsche. \r\n Satanás é o antídoto para a culpa, a morte, o medo … \r\n Satã é a indulgência '(da qual Nietzsche falou)
 >>26787434 \r\n Bom é você largar essa merda e tomar vergonha na cara e se voltar ao racionalismo. Toda religião é uma forma de muleta, coisa de fracassado que pra ver sentido na vida precisa ouvir que é um floquinho de neve especial, ou que ele é um miserável. Apenas as pagãs ainda tem alguma justificativa, além de belas mitologias. O resto para o esgoto vai.
