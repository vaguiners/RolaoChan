 My family does not believe that I can speak the English Fluently, /b/. \r\n \r\n What the hell am I supposed to do? \r\n \r\n How can I prove to them that I am a fluent speaker? \r\n I thought about calling an American friend and speaking to him in front of my family \r\n Would they be impressed or is my plan too cringe?
 >my family does not believe that I can speak the English Fluently, /b/. \r\n Neither do I.
 >My family does not believe that I can speak the English Fluently, /b/. \r\n You can't, smartass.
 Go get atropelated.
 My family dooesn't believe I speak English fluently.
 Little monkey.

 'Cringy', não 'cringe', macaco, cringy é o adjetivo do seu plano, cringe é o ato em si.

 Your english is shit and you don't even realize it. Everyone in your family knows your english is god awful, so you come here and make this retarded thread to try and feel a bit better about yourself. Guess what? Your family is right and your english is abysmal. I don't even hate you because you don't know english, I hate you because you made this stupid thread thinking you dominate the language when you clearly don't. \r\n \r\n I hope you die of gonorrhea you AIDS riddled faggot.
 Lurka o /int/ do 4falhas que seu inglês melhora anão.
 >>27435141 \r\n >I hate you because you made this stupid thread thinking you dominate the language \r\n >dominate the language \r\n \r\n Essa parte ficou estranha. Eu usaria 'thinking you've mastered the language' em vez de 'dominate'.
