 Can you hear them? \r\n The helicopters? \r\n I'm in New York \r\n No need for words now \r\n We sit in silence \r\n You look me \r\n In the eye directly \r\n You met me \r\n I think it's Wednesday \r\n The evening \r\n The mess we're in and \r\n The city sun sets over me \r\n \r\n Night and day \r\n I dream of \r\n Making-love \r\n To you now baby \r\n Love-making \r\n On-screen \r\n Impossible dream \r\n And I have seen \r\n The sunrise \r\n Over the river \r\n The freeway \r\n Reminding \r\n Of this mess we're in and \r\n The city sun sets over me \r\n \r\n What were you wanting? \r\n I just want to say \r\n Don't ever change now baby \r\n And thank you \r\n I don't think we will meet again \r\n And you must leave now \r\n Before the sunrise \r\n Above skyscrapers \r\n The sin and \r\n This mess we're in and \r\n The city sun sets over me
