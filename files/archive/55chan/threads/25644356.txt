 I think Earth is a pretty gr-eat place \r\n That's saying something, cuz' I've been through outer space \r\n I think it suits me, it's just mah' sty-le \r\n I think I'm gonna stay a little whi-le \r\n I think that strangers are just friends you haven't met \r\n I'm blasting monsters and I neva' break a sweat \r\n I'm really thinking I could call this pl-ace home!
 Só bichas e lacradoras assistem essa merda. Qual dos dois você é, OP?
