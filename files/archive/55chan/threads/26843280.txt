 >Do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n I haven't really spoken it for over a year now, but 2~3 days of intense speaking would fix my accent in no time, which even now isn't that bad. \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n I'm done studying it already. \r\n >How did you learn it? \r\n Wizard, back in ~2014. I'd also consume lots of content in english as I took the course, which really helped me learn more. \r\n >>26843286 \r\n >>26843305 \r\n >>26843307 \r\n This is what severe cases of Ligma look like.

 >How fluent are you? \r\n I'm not fluent, but i can pretty much work around with what I have. \r\n >Do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n I can listen very well, althoug I have some trouble with certain accents, like the brits and australians, who seems to have potatos in their mouths when speaking. My writing is not very good, but I'm seeing some improvements and I speak like a african. \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n Since 2014. \r\n >How did you learn it? \r\n Books, cartoons, videos, movies and games .
 >>26843441 \r\n Well, I got the first question wrong. I can't' say I'm advanced, but I'm not intermediary either. I'm in between.
 Yes, I speak. \r\n I think I am a lot fluent. \r\n I do not have any problems in understanding my little games. \r\n Since I begin playing video games. More or less 20 years. \r\n I already spoke it, though video games. \r\n Any more questions, OP?

 >>26843490 \r\n >since 8 \r\n \r\n Really? \r\n So English sounds just as natural to you as Portuguese, right?

 >Do you speak English? \r\n I'd like to think so, yeah. \r\n \r\n >How fluent are you? \r\n Fluent enough to read books, watch movies and play video-games.

Also my writing can be full of SICs… \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n I started doing english courses when i was 8 or 7, finished with 16yo (i'm 19yo today). Now i just pratice my english by using the internet outside this shithole (and series, movies, animes, yt, Conan O'Brian, chans…) \r\n How did you learn it? \r\n Proper education, i guess. \r\n \r\n >>26843647 \r\n Didn't you know this place is full of 'descolixos'?

Don't worry. \r\n \r\n >finished with 16yo \r\n >with \r\n \r\n Is this correct? Wouldn't it be 'when I was 16yo'? \r\n I always thought that writing that way as we do in our native language was wrong.

 >O “A” refere-se aos níveis iniciais e básicos do idioma e significa que quem o domina consegue compreender e usar expressões familiares e cotidianas que satisfazem suas necessidades básicas. Aqui estão categorizados os alunos recentes, que são capazes de se comunicar em tarefas simples e rotinas que exijam apenas uma troca rápida e fácil de informações. \r\n >Já o “B” classifica um usuário com um pouco mais de conhecimento e entendimento da língua. O B1 é o nível intermediário, no qual a pessoa compreende as questões principais de assuntos que lhe são familiares e consegue reproduzir discursos simples e coerentes sobre os temas que conhece. E, a partir do B2, já vemos indivíduos mais independentes quanto ao uso do idioma, já que deve compreender desde ideias principais de textos mais complexos sobre tópicos concretos e abstratos, até discussões técnicas sobre sua área de especialidade. Além disso, a partir daí ele começa a conseguir se comunicar com espontaneidade com falantes nativos sem que haja uma tensão durante o diálogo. \r\n >Por fim, o “C” é o nível mais alto que se pode chegar. Ele simboliza o usuário proficiente e é o nível solicitado na maioria das vezes para quem pretende estudar ou trabalhar fora. O C1 significa a habilidade de compreender um vasto número de textos longos e exigentes e se comunicar de forma fluente e espontânea sem precisar pensar muito nas palavras, conseguir usar a língua de modo eficaz em quase todas as suas áreas de convivência. E o C2 é o nível de domínio pleno de inglês, em que o aluno compreende sem esforço algum praticamente tudo o que ouve ou lê e consegue também se comunicar espontaneamente e de modo fluente com exatidão. \r\n \r\n Acredito ser B1. Consigo falar normal, ler normal, escrever normal, certamente com uma caralhada de erros, mas a comunicação se estabelece. Ler/escrever ou falar sobre coisas mais técnicas não dá.

 >Do you speak English? \r\n Yes \r\n >How fluent are you? \r\n Extremely so. \r\n >Do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n Nope. I can't really understand the lyrics in rap songs but I guess it's because they aren't speaking english. \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n Since I was 5 or so and got my Snes and everything was in english. \r\n >How did you learn it? \r\n Videogames, finding out about imageboards when I was 12 or so, you know the 'english internet' always seemed so much cooler than the 'portuguese one', I just wanted to get onto it asap. Having to deal with foreigners for years due to work also definitely helped. I did enroll in an english course for a few years but I believe it barely helped, if at all. Cultura Inglesa it was, honestly I'm pretty sure I knew more than the teachers even when I was 14.
 >do you speak English? \r\n Yeah. \r\n >how fluent are you? \r\n Quite a bit. I don't talk to anyone, but i can listen and understand just fine. \r\n >do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n Not really, but it can be a little difficult if there's a very strong accent in the pronunciation. Fuck britcornos \r\n >how long have you been studying English? \r\n Since i got my first computer, at 6 years old. \r\n >how did you learn it? \r\n First i already had this book that taught the most basic words of the language, i read it a lot when i was bored so i learned everything. When i got to the internet i liked to interact in the communities of games i played, which were mostly foreign, and that helped a lot. A bit of time later i was already advanced in the language and didn't even know it. Not 'perfect', before you fags come and mock me for getting a word or two wrong. \r\n Stopping to think right now, i literally can't remember anything about my life before i knew english.

É possível sobreviver com apenas Inglês, porque a grande maioria das pessoas falam em inglês, mas você não consegue fazer parte da cultura e arrumar amigos sem o polonês.

 >>26844825 \r\n >Sometimes I do think it can make me come off as a weirdo but hey, I was born a weirdo anyways. \r\n Same. Sometimes i think i wasn't born to interact with the monkeys of this fucked country. Not trying to be a bootlicker, but watch a conversation between casual friends from some country like the USA or Europe and watch one between Brazilians. In english countries it's much more natural to have a 'richer' conversation among normalfags. What would otherwise be normal in these places, here in Shitzil comes off as pretentious 'wannabe-intellectual' sounding shit, you have to talk like a complete monkey to socialize around here, and i hate it.
 >>26844884 \r\n That reminds me I was watching a documentary about Elliot Rodgers earlier today. Even if that dude was completely nuts, I'll be damned if he wasn't really relatable at times.

 >>26844905 \r\n Well, let me leave my two cents on this. It might just be a case of 'the grass is always greener on the other side' for you. I've been living abroad for over 3 years now (though I'm not sure if it really qualifies as 'USA or Europe', since it's fucking Portugal) but most casual conversations are of the same level here. You'll have the same pointless bickering over football and other useless topics. HOWEVER, and I made sure to capitalize this one for a damn good reason, it was only here that I manage to find people that could also talk about other stuff openly, I just had to do some digging. Now I've a small group of friends I can talk about VNs and fighting games with and it's something I'd never see happening in Brazil,a nd something I thought I'd only ever be able to do online.
 >>26844917 \r\n Just interact more. Go lurk on /pinto/, 8chan and places like that until you're good enough to be talking naturally there. Knowing how to form sentences comes before trying to pronunciate them.
 >>26844917 \r\n This: >>26844943 . \r\n And start talking to yourself.

 >>26844990 \r\n >How can people do not know \r\n Fixed.
 >>26844990 \r\n I don't wanna something complicated. What do you faggots think about italian? It's like spanish, but more portuguese.
 >>26844932 \r\n I get your point, but what i mean really is something more like this: If you read a book, in brazillian portuguese, and then go have a conversation with your usual brazillian normalfags (even ones that aren't necessarily poor and uneducated) the difference is astronomical. Casual conversation around here has to be full of slangs, you HAVE to 'eat' some letters when saying certain words (saying 'as coisa' em vez de 'as coisas' is wrong but it's what everyone does and sounds socially weird if you don't, for example), you have to say everything wrong in a 'right way' (get what i mean?), etc. Doesn't matter if people are talking about WAHMIN or if they're talking about high art, a casual conversation in Brazil ALWAYS follows these rules. \r\n In english-speaking countries this is already different, if you read a book in english, and then go talk to people in english in that place, there's almost no difference (unless you're reading something very technical). You don't have to 'speak wrong in the right ways', you don't have to 'eat the S', you can express all that you want to say without having to adapt it to monkey-speak and it will still come off perfectly natural. \r\n But in Brazil people are so stupid and fucked-up levels of stupid that they can't even speak their own language right, and with lots of time being like this, that became the norm. \r\n I can't really speak for Portugal because i never traveled outside my state, but i have a question: do people over there, when talking casually, butcher the language as much as brazillians do around here?
 >Do you speak English? \r\n Somewhat. \r\n >How fluent are you? \r\n Not very much. \r\n >Do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n Mainly speaking and listening, but I also have some (a lot) trouble with writing. Reading is the easiest for me. \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n I don't know if I actually studied it. Does going to a good private school, then playing video games and watching american sitcom with english subtitles just because it's better for understanding count as studying? \r\n >How did you learn it? \r\n I have no idea how exactly. I guess those classes in school really nailed into my head.
 Gosto desse tipo de thread, mas v-vou responder em português. \r\n >Do you speak English? \r\n S-sim. \r\n >How fluent are you? \r\n Teoricamente entre o B1 e o B2. Soa um pouco estranho, porque às vezes sinto que já sei bastante, às vezes sinto que não sei quase nada. \r\n >Do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n Com certeza. O próprio fato de eu estar respondendo em português já demonstra minha falha no writing, mas acho que no listening e principalmente no speaking a situação é mais complicada. Eu viajei para os EUA há alguns meses e na maioria das vezes eu consegui me virar bem, mas eu estava turistando numa região turística entupida de latinos. Se fosse trabalhar ou estudar numa cidade aleatória iria me fornicar bastante. \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n 3 anos e meio. \r\n >How did you learn it? \r\n Comecei fazendo 1 ano na Fisk. Depois migrei para um curso na minha própria faculdade e fiquei lá até o ano passado. Nessa época eu já tinha percebido que só fazer um curso não resolve, que eu precisava fazer algo a mais. \r\n Neste ano essa pressão aumentou justamente por eu ter dropado o curso. Eu comecei com uma meta de ler 1 matéria de jornal em inglês por dia, mas desisti depois de alguns dias. Era muito cansativo. Então eu comecei a assistir Friends com legendas em inglês. É uma série leve, divertida e que já assisti inteira, então se eu não entendesse alguma coisa (e isso sempre acontecesse) não faria tanta diferença. Por enquanto tem dado certo. Eu também lurko em algumas pranchas do 4folhas, mas ainda tenho dificuldade de tornar isso um hábito diário. \r\n Por mais que essas práticas que eu adotei ensinem bastante eu ainda senti falta do 'método escolar' (alguém te ensinando), então baixei a Corujinha Verde e comecei um curso do 0 pra revisar alguns conceitos básicos. Gasto 5 minutos do meu dia usando ele, o que não é muito (principalmente se levar em conta que as lições são bem básicas) mas pelo menos me ajuda a manter algo que por conta própria eu não consigo: o hábito de estudar.
 >>26845293 \r\n Imersão é algo bom pra aprender uma língua, você realmente deveria tentar mais isso. Eu só estudei mesmo inglês seriamente por umas duas semanas e o resto foi só por imersão. Eu aprendo vendo filmes, lendo mangos e shitpostando na internet. Zero esforço.

 >>26845079 \r\n Sorry for the late reply, looks like I was so immersed english I ended up getting banned for an hour due to spelling mistakes on another thread, such is life. \r\n So that's what you were talking about, I had a feeling I was missing your point slightly by the time I hit reply and re read your post. But anyways, funnily enough, people here in Portugal talk casually like people here talk when they want to seem sophiscated and smart, I'm talking about heavy usage of second person here. It's kinda surreal here, at first you feel like you've been transported into the past when you hear two portuguese talking to each other. \r\n I'm not sure if it counts as butchering the language as much as it is just an accent, though you're right that this leads to the degeneration of the language and that's how the US ended up with Ebonics after all.
 >>26845477 \r\n By the few that i know about PT-PT from watching youtube, i'd say they don't really have a spoken language problem as we have here. Most of the time they speak everything correctly and it sounds natural. Your post more or less confirmed that, after all. I used to think it was just because they were presenting videos I'm not surprised tho, of course an european country that isn't full of low-IQ simians like Brazil will have a much more 'language-cultured' population than us. It's just Brazil being Brazil. \r\n \r\n Also, Portugal sounds like a nice place, if i ever get the money to travel i might consider making a visit there.
 >>26843280 \r\n >Do you speak English? \r\n Yes. \r\n >How fluent are you? \r\n I'd say either C1 or C2, perhaps? \r\n >Do you have any trouble listening, writing or speaking English? \r\n No. \r\n >How long have you been studying English? \r\n For about nine years, and I haven't studied for about 3 years. \r\n >How did you learn it? \r\n English courses, private teachers and so on.
