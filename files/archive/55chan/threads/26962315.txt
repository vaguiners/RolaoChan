 And it never really began \r\n But in my heart it was so real \r\n And you even spoke to me, and said \r\n If you're so funny \r\n Then why are you on your own tonight? \r\n And if you're so clever \r\n Then why are you on your own tonight? \r\n If you're so very entertaining \r\n Then why are you on your own tonight? \r\n If you're so very good-looking \r\n Why do you sleep alone tonight? \r\n I know \r\n Because tonight is \r\n Just like any other night \r\n That's why you're on your own tonight \r\n With your triumphs and your charms \r\n While they're in each other's arms
 >If you're so very good-looking \r\n >Why do you sleep alone tonight? \r\n \r\n Metida de real nos falhos bonitões.
 Tá ruim? Pode piorar.
