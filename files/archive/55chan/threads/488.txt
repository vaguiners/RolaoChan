The Smoking Gun reveals the identify of the director of '2 Girls, 1 Cup,' the internet's latest shock-meme. 2G1C's director is a Brazilian named Marco Fiorito. The 36-year-old from Sao Paulo describes himself as a 'compulsive fetishist' and 'an artist in the art of movie making.' He started a porn production company with his wife in the mid-'90s, focusing at first on foot fetish films: \r\n \r\n While Fiorito contends that his revolting films are not illegal in Brazil, some of his works have been branded obscene by U.S. prosecutors and led last year to the indictment of Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer who lived in Florida and was listed on corporate documents as an officer of a company distributing Fiorito's films. \r\n \r\n 'In his legal declaration, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Orlando, Fiorito contended that Croce, 43, had no role in his movie business, other than helping to process credit card transactions through a travel company the attorney owned. In June, Croce, who cooperated with investigators, copped a plea and was later sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation (since he was returning to Brazil) and ordered to forfeit $98,000. \r\n \r\n In his declaration, Fiorito explained that had he known that selling his films in the U.S. was illegal, 'I would have stopped because the money is not the main reason that I make these films.' He then added, 'I have already made fetish movies with scat/feces using chocolate instead of feces. Many actors make scat films but they don't agree to eat feces.' \r\n \r\n Sauce: \r\n http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/30/real-poop-behind-2g1.html \r\n
