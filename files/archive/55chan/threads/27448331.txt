 Yeah, she lookin' clean, Raf Simons jeans \r\n I'm up in the club, rollin' off a bean \r\n I give her a glance, I know she notice me \r\n Seen her on the gram, I know she follow me \r\n Crackin' cards all on my own \r\n Pour a six to make me feel at home \r\n We in the back, she wanna fuck \r\n She hear my song, she know what's up \r\n I see the fake, it tears me up \r\n I'm losin' hope, I've lost my soul \r\n These demons call, won't leave me 'lone \r\n I need you, babygirl, I need you, yeah 
 Que merda, jovem.
 Nem precisei abrir o vídeo pra saber que é música de judeu. Dá pra saber só pela letra. \r\n Sageru em thread de u nderage.
