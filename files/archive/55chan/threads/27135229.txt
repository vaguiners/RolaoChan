 You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain? \r\n I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim \r\n Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force \r\n Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh \r\n Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence \r\n 'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent \r\n What's the justice in sayin', 'Fuck it,' and grab the pump? \r\n Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump \r\n Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon \r\n Think about the people who own it for about a second \r\n I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs \r\n This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair \r\n But yo, you'd rather hear me say, 'Fuck the black prejudice \r\n Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant \r\n Views' and etcetera, knives thrown \r\n Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious \r\n I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance \r\n Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it \r\n Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em \r\n Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em \r\n Murder 'em, never heard of 'em \r\n I could preach the peace but say, 'Fuck it,' and preach the murder \r\n 'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin' \r\n Go ahead and grab the extension \r\n Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son \r\n Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence== \r\n But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance \r\n Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' blackâ€”
