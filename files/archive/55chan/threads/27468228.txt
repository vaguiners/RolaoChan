 'Depression is actually a sign of mentally evolving. The reason you are no longer happy is because this reality has become old/obsolete/ and repetitive. It's your higher self's way of telling you that you can do better and it's time to grow/awaken. Most people who suffer from depression are usually the ones trying to prevent this growth. The (society/world) we live in is based on chasing 'numbers' which is money. Deep deep deep subconsciously you have realized that there is something wrong and unfulfilling about this routine you have been taught to maintain and follow which you have called 'LIFE' throughout time. Take this as an example: If you kept eating bread and water for 10 years eventually you will get tired of it because it has become old/repetitive/ and obsolete to where it has become unfulfilling, eventually your mind will send off a signal to go look for something new and refreshing because it's time for a change and improvement. It's the same thing with depression, it's time for a change. There's nothing wrong with feeling unfulfilled, it doesn't mean your not being thankful, it means it's time for an upgrade while you have time left in this world.' \r\n \r\n Rivotrill.
