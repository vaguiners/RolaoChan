 Vale a pena fazer o curso de inglês do Mairo Vergara?
 I dont need curses, i learn from games.
 Quando alguém é muito bom no marketing, fico com um pé atrás quanto a qualidade.
 Não.
 Five zero percent, OP.
 Yeah, better than nothing you don't even need to leave your house lmao
 English courses are nothing but a jewish trickery.
 >>27034827 \r\n I also. I doesn't need no courses or schools of english. I learn among games.
 No, you dumbass. Learn just enough from textbooks so that you can bootstrap yourself into talking with actual english speakers. \r\n Reading classic books (I recommend a torrent of the Penguin's Classics collection that's floating around the web) is a great way of enhancing your vocabulary as well. Buying a Kindle is a better use of your money compared to paying some random retard from the internet to tell you things you should already know.
 Baixei o curso dele completo por torresmo. Não regreto nada.
 Yeah, I myself took the course, heard and spoke a thousand times 'my lord bag of rice'.
