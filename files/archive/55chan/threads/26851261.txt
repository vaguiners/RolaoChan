 Still will I sing to soothe my heart, \r\n Deprest, alas! and full of care; \r\n Not even yet shall hope depart— \r\n Not even yet will I despair. \r\n Though none from that wild shore return \r\n Where he abides I love so well, \r\n Whose absence I forever mourn, \r\n Whose voice to me was music’s spell; \r\n God! when the battle cry resounds, \r\n Thy succour to the Pilgrim show, \r\n Whom fatal treachery surrounds— \r\n For faithless is the Heathen foe! \r\n \r\n No time my sorrow can assuage \r\n Till I behold him once again; \r\n He roams in weary pilgrimage, \r\n And I await in ceaseless pain: \r\n And though my lineage urge me long \r\n With threats another’s bride to be, \r\n In vain they seek to do him wrong— \r\n All idle seem their frowns to me. \r\n Noble he is, and I am fair; \r\n Ah, Heaven! all mercy since thou art, \r\n Why doom two hearts to this despair, \r\n Why bid us thus so rudely part? \r\n \r\n One tender solace yet I find— \r\n His vows are mine, my treasured store! \r\n And when I feel the gentle wind \r\n That blows from yonder distant shore, \r\n I turn me to the balmy gale, \r\n Its whisp’ring breath my fancy charms, \r\n I list his tender voice to hail, \r\n He seems to clasp me in his arms! \r\n \r\n He left me! ah, what vain regret! \r\n I may not follow where he flies!— \r\n The scarf he gave, when last we met, \r\n A cherished relic still I prize: \r\n I fold it to my throbbing heart, \r\n And many a vanish’d scene recall; \r\n For quiet to my soul distrest, \r\n For joy, for solace—this is all! \r\n God! when the battle cry resounds, \r\n Thy succour to the Pilgrim show, \r\n Whom fatal treachery surrounds, \r\n For faithless is the Heathen foe!
 Salve Rei Balduíno IV de Jerusalém!
 Taí, curti.
