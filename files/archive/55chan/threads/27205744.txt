 Bom dia!
 Bom dia, anãozinho femdonzeiro! :3 \r\n Estava sentindo falta de você por aqui.
 Aproveitando a thread, você já assitiu MM? \r\n Depois de assistir esses dias entendi a razão de você gostar tanto desse fetiche. \r\n Pena que não tem mais animes deste tipo. ;_;
 Que coisa horrível. Femdom é merda. \r\n Gentle femdom é o fetiche dos patrícios.
 Meu saco começou a doer só de ver isso aí.
 Psychologically, it is impossible for a woman to be truly dominant. To be dominant one must learn what it means to be disciplined, commanding, and have a strong sense of will. Most importantly though is the experience of gaining what you have through work and/or hardship. Society coddles women. They are handed opportunities and adoration by virtue of their sex. They do not know the experience of true hardship, only imagined. They do not know how to truly command obedience, be disciplined, or have strong willpower. A woman can gain everything having sacrificed and striven for nothing. She reaches the throne on the backs of other's efforts, blissfully ignorant of her lacking effort. \r\n \r\n Thus when you meet a 'dominant' woman, what you meet is a fake. A hollow shell. A simulacrum of dominance. A man who is dominant commands respect and demands obedience. He puts those who submit to him in their place with a firm hand and unflinching will. A 'dominant' woman is a living fallacy. Her 'dominance' is just self aggrandizing masturbation. Her brittle shell will break the at the first moment of true resistance. Her tough and commanding demeanor shattered by a simple slur or negative assertion. Whether she enters a rage or cries bitter, stinging tears matters little. She is defeated, laid low by one supposedly the 'submissive.' \r\n \r\n Such is what it means to be the so called fairer sex. This is why women should be at home as submissives.
