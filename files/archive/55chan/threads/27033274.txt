 Você gosta de Phil Collins?
 Não. Prefiro Peter Gabriel.
 Eh… tanto faz.
 Do you like MC Igu? \r\n His early work was a little too desconfortável for my taste. But when Camiseta Confortável EP came out in '17, I think he really came into his own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of conforto that really gives the songs a big boost.
 Quem?
