 Oh, I see her face everywhere I go \r\n On the street and even at the picture show \r\n Have you seen her? \r\n Tell me, have you seen her? \r\n \r\n Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow \r\n In the sweet music on my radio \r\n Have you seen her? \r\n Tell me, have you seen her?
 Love, oh love \r\n I gotta tell you how I feel about you \r\n Cause I, oh I \r\n Can't go a minute without your love \r\n \r\n Like a satellite \r\n I'm in orbit all the way around you \r\n And I would fall out into the night \r\n Can't go a minute without your love
 Que música é?
