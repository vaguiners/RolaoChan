 We are not your kind of people \r\n Don't want to be like you ever in our lives \r\n We are not your kind of people \r\n We fight when you start talking \r\n There's nothing but white noise
 Sai do chan, Kojima.
 RULES OF NATURE! 
 Faintly I'll go \r\n To take this head on \r\n \r\n Soon I'll come around \r\n Lost and never found \r\n Waiting for my words \r\n Seen but never heard \r\n Buried underground \r\n But I'll keep coming
