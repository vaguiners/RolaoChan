 In this thread is only allowed to speak English, come practice your english and talk with the anonymous friends. Monkeys language isn't acceptable here.
 What would you do if I speak brazilian language?
 Wow. Where's everybody?

 Pau no seu cuzinho.
 Of course, the monkey languange is the one descendent from latim that came from the people who brought civilization to the barbarians that later developed the shitty and simple languange known as english that even a retarded with down can learn.
 Mama meu xalau, faggote.
 I'm here to train with the anons. I'll try not to use a translator. \r\n Please, don't be rude with me, ok? I'm a bit shy about write and speak, but I know 'video games' english'. \r\n \r\n Let's be fair together and learn something.

 If I were to speak english, I would type '4­c­han' in my browser address bar, instead of '55chan'. The same can be said about any language. \r\n \r\n If you really knew how to speak english you would be there, instead of here, talking with people who don't really know. Hope you aren't doing so because there you are mocked for knowing too little, while in here people think you're the man for just knowing how to type in words in another language. This 'seeing people worse than me makes me feel good' stuff is just for pathetic people.
