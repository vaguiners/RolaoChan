 Qual é sua frase de música preferida de todos os tempos?
 I Won't Back Down
 Nothing really matters to me
 I want your love and I want your revenge
 Eu tenho a madrugada como companheira.
 Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore
 Sem orgia de travecos fico triste e deprimido, \r\n Com orgia de travecos viro soropositivo.
 Disciplina é liberdade.
 Why pamper life's complexity, when the leather runs smooth on the passenger's seat?
 Nowhere is there warmth to be found \r\n Among those afraid of losing their mind.
 It's no fun to burn in hell's fire \r\n But I sure have enjoyed my life.
 What have I become \r\n My sweetest friend \r\n Everyone I know \r\n Goes away in the end
