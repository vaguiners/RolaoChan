 When I find myself in times of trouble \r\n Mother Mary comes to me \r\n Speaking words of wisdom \r\n Let it be \r\n \r\n And in my hour of darkness \r\n She is standing right in front of me \r\n Speaking words of wisdom \r\n Let it be
 Olá, Paulo. Bela música.
 >>27521742 \r\n Obrigado, mas meu nome não é Paulo. \r\n Você quis fazer uma piada com o nome de Paul McCartney? 

 So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise \r\n You better see right through that mother's eyes \r\n Those freaks was right when they said you was dead \r\n The one mistake you made was in your head \r\n \r\n Ah, how do you sleep \r\n Ah, how do you sleep at night \r\n \r\n You live with straights who tell you, you was king \r\n Jump when your momma tell you anything \r\n The only thing you done was yesterday \r\n And since you're gone you're just another day \r\n \r\n Ah, how do you sleep \r\n Ah, how do you sleep at night \r\n \r\n Ah, how do you sleep \r\n Ah, how do you sleep at night \r\n \r\n A pretty face may last a year or two \r\n But pretty soon they'll see what you can do \r\n The sound you make is muzak to my ears \r\n You must have learned something in all those years \r\n \r\n Ah, how do you sleep \r\n Ah, how do you sleep at night
 Gosta de Wings, OP?
 >>27521755 \r\n Sim. 
 Eita que hoje tá fornicação.
 >>27521765 \r\n Não conheço, pra falar a verdade conheço muito pouco sobre o rock dessa época.
 AT THE SEETHING AND FIERY CENTER, HE SITS UPON HIS EBON THRONE, \r\n WITHIN HIS HALLS OF DARKNESS, WHICH NO MAN HAS SEEN AND SURVIVED THE VISION. \r\n BOTH BLIND AND BEREFT OF MIND, HE PIPES UNCEASINGLY ON HIS REED FLUTE, \r\n AND THE NOTES THAT RISE AND FALL IN MEASURED PATTERNS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL THE WORLDS, \r\n EVER CALCULATING IN SOUND THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE AND TIME. \r\n \r\n WERE HIS FLUTE EVER TO SUDDENLY FALL SILENT, ALL THE SPHERES WOULD SHATTER INTO ONE ANOTHER. \r\n AND THE MYRIADS OF WORLDS WOULD BE UNMADE, AS THEY WERE BEFORE CREATION. \r\n THE FLUTE OF THE BLIND IDIOT BOTH MAKES AND UNMAKES THE WORLDS IN CEASELESS COMBINATIONS, \r\n SPINNING ON THE WOVEN CARPET OF TIME. \r\n \r\n NO CREATION WITHOUT DESTRUCTION; \r\n NO DESTRUCTION WITHOUT CREATION. \r\n TO UNMAKE A THING IS TO MAKE ANOTHER. \r\n EACH TIME A THING IS MADE, ANOTHER IS DESTROYED. \r\n \r\n THE IDIOT GOD, ON HIS BLACK THRONE, \r\n DOES NOT CHOOSE WHAT SHALL RISE INTO BEING, AND WHAT SHOULD PASS AWAY; \r\n HE CARES ONLY TO MAINTAIN HIS MINDLESS UNHOLY MUSIC OF RANDOM CREATION AND DESTRUCTION. \r\n \r\n NO LIVING CREATURE CAN LOOK UPON HIS FACE AND ENDURE ITS TERRIBLE HEAT AND BLACK RADIANCE, \r\n THAT IS LIKE THE REVERBERATING UNSEEN RAYS OF MOLTEN IRON, \r\n WHICH STRIKE AND BURN THE SKIN OF THOSE WHO WOULD DARE GAZE INTO THE COUNTENANCE OF THE IDIOT GOD. \r\n \r\n NEVER DOES HE RECEIVE SUPPLICANTS IN HIS BLACK HALLS OF UNCOUTH ANGLES, \r\n NOR DOES HE EVER HEAR PRAYERS OR ANSWER THEM; ENDLESSLY, HE PIPES. \r\n ENDLESSLY HE DEVOURS HIS OWN SUBSTANCE, FOR HIS HUNGER IS INSATIABLE; \r\n AS HE CONSUMES HIS OWN WASTES, AFTER THE CUSTOM OF IDIOTS \r\n \r\n AS THE GOD CREATES, SO HE DESTROYS; \r\n AS THE GOD DESTROYS, SO HE CREATES.
