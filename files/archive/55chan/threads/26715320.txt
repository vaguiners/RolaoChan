 Militants, occupying large parts of the Syrian province of Idlib are readying a false flag attack involving chemical weaponry, the head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria, Major General Viktor Kupchishin said on Friday. \r\n \r\n ''A batch of poisonous gas, believed to be chlorine-based, has been already delivered to a number of villages in the Idlib province. The poison is packed in canisters disguised as oxygen and natural gas tanks, according to the Russian military. \r\n \r\n The plotters have discussed the filming of the upcoming false flag attack and are expected to repurpose footage of a recent Russian strike on a drone warehouse in Idlib to “prove” Moscow’s involvement. \r\n \r\n While the “actors” are offered some $100 for playing the roles of chemical attack victims, there’s a distinct possibility that the militants will poison people for real to make the video more “lifelike,” the official warned.'' \r\n \r\n https://www.rt.com/news/455104-syria-france-belgium-chemical-weapon/amp/?__twitter_impression=true
