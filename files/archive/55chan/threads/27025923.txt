 >>27026081 \r\n You should start watching movies with english subtitles, it gets easier after a while.
 >>27026081 \r\n Immersion is the word. \r\n Can you understand Varg? He speaks clearly and slowly.

 >>27026105 \r\n >>27026121 \r\n Yeah anons, as i have watched in Nerdologia, Átila tells that exposition to another language makes our neurons work better and 'forces' new ways to get improve on listening and speaking these words. \r\n \r\n >>27026122 \r\n I can understand a big part of this video, but i still should have a intense training for make this better.
 >>27026148 \r\n t. literally nigger.

 Eu entendo, só não sei escrever em inglês.

 The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as 'the greatest or most significant or most influential' rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
 >>27026179 \r\n I won't, it can't be that bad.
 Ela virou uma feminista tumbler.
 >>27026179 \r\n >this kike trying to hide his heritage

 >>27026188 \r\n I'm learning some expressions too, monkey. I really don't know how to exactly answer any thing to any question or opinion. I never know how to concordate with something 
 >>27026174 \r\n Quantas horas por dia você estuda? \r\n Quais sites você usa? \r\n Quais são seus métodos?
 >>27026203 \r\n Fuck you, I'm not a kike. It's only about my werid nose.
 >>27026140 \r\n Stop trying to be funny. \r\n \r\n >>27026169 \r\n >nerdologia \r\n YIKES. But about english, the more exposure the more you adapt. It's like a second mind, a murica mind, you will think like an monkey and like a mutt in the future, the next step for mankind. \r\n \r\n Me, an intelctual enjoy the most of talkshows and foreign channels. Try some Conan.
 >>27026187 \r\n You ever try? \r\n I don't know how write too, i just type random thing on my keyboard and the magic happens, i use grammar corrector that helps me a lot. 
 >>27026213 \r\n Hey, anon, do you know the difference between a pizza and you? The pizza won't scream in the oven.
 >>27026222 \r\n >Stop trying to be funny. \r\n Chup my eggs.
 >>27026097 \r\n Is it gay to like women like that?

 >>27026256 \r\n >podcasts \r\n KYS, soyboy.
 >>27026256 \r\n Thanks for the bro fix. I'm kinda drunk right now.
 >>27026261 \r\n That's fucking gay.
 >>27026261 \r\n Pixie cut != tomboy, though.
 >>27026222 \r\n >It's like a second mind \r\n \r\n This. \r\n People think that when you learn a second language, you just speak that language and that's it. Truth is that you feel different when you're immersed in that language. It feels weird writing in English on 55chan and other Brazilian websites because it feels forced for some reason but when I'm on /pinto/, it feels just as natural as my native language. That's why I've decided to dedicate my life to studying other languages. I'm currently studying German and French.
 >>27026256 \r\n >Boomer humor \r\n How was that ninja's fortnite let's play? How was the last pewds vid? How is school, kid?
 >>27026270 \r\n >Pixie cut \r\n Tits or get the fuck out.
 >>27026256 \r\n t. doomer
 >>27026244 \r\n >>27026249 \r\n But they're cute. \r\n \r\n >>27026261 \r\n Its a shame most of them are feminist scum.
 >>27026271 \r\n What are you even gonna use German and French for? \r\n \r\n >>27026280 \r\n >absolute buttmad over literally nothing 
 What are you guys listening right now? Post it, please. I've been on this video for more than one hour.
 >>27026293 \r\n Is cute because she is white, try with a black woman, ugly as hell. 
 >>27026271 \r\n That is why i hate when people ask me to 'translate' stuff, when you know a language you just think in that language. If someone ask me to translate something to portuguese, i need to re-think the whole thing. \r\n \r\n >>27026303 \r\n Don't forget to like and subscribe, hit that bell button and an heroin shot up your arm. \r\n \r\n >>27026293 \r\n It can be even worse, fuckin' dykes.

 >>27026306 
 >>27026326 \r\n >that smile \r\n >that hair \r\n >cute 
 Go back to r9k, stupid disgusting monkey.
 >>27026326 \r\n Ugly and thats too long.
 What the term 'virtually' means?
 But I do speak english.
 >>27026351 \r\n That depends, there're more than just one definition.
 >>27026338 \r\n The only thing you could complain was about the tattoo. \r\n But you got the gay, brah. \r\n \r\n >>27026349 \r\n Another one with the gay.
 >>27026355 \r\n >boxxy \r\n Oh boy, good old days.
 Gather around, pals. \r\n We gonna have a 'conversation class ! \r\n \r\n We got the topics; \r\n >food you like/despise \r\n >your first girl \r\n >and 9/11 
 >>27026351 \r\n In a quote like 'Virtually, every single soldier present in the slaughter didn't move a hand against him', what does it mean? \r\n \r\n Forgive me if I wrote something wrong.
 >>27026407 \r\n https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/virtually 
 >>27026378 \r\n I did not even see the tattoo. \r\n >follow \r\n Must be something like follow me on páçaro.
 >>27026404 \r\n >your first girl \r\n W-what do you mean?

 Finally a thread where we can speak english openly without being ridiculed. \r\n Feels good, man.
 >>27026427 \r\n Anon, you know. \r\n Your first girlfriend, how was?
 >>27026407 \r\n >>27026430 \r\n I'd translate it to something like 'realmente'.
 >>27026439 \r\n Inbreed.
 >>27026444 \r\n Like a square root of -1, imaginary. 
 >>27026293 \r\n Holy shit, the middle one. I think you've just ruined regular girls for me. I finally found my favourite type of woman. \r\n \r\n Do you have any sauce on that?
 >>27026444 \r\n I-it w-was-s n-nice, s-she was real-lly p-pret-tty.
 >>27026046 \r\n Essa lésbica está toda estragada. É por isso que dá vontade de matar ela. Essas threads são iguais as de academia ou qual seu álbum favorito (aí os caras postam a coisa mais cult e diferentona que ninguém conhece e ficam disputando) esse tipo de cocô deveria ser banido desse fórum.
 >>27026480 \r\n Sorry, random one.
 BLOW OUT YOUR ASS. 
 >>27026480 \r\n \r\n I don't get what makes her so special besides the hair.
 >>27026497 \r\n Do you have more pics of Julia?
 >>27026524 \r\n No, my dear anon. I was here when the thread came out and watched her live video for a bit, that's all. Pretty feet though.
