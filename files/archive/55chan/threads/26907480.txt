 I never thought I'd die alone \r\n I laughed the loudest who'd have known? \r\n I trace the cord back to the wall \r\n No wonder it was never plugged in at all \r\n I took my time, I hurried up \r\n The choice was mine I didn't think enough \r\n I'm too depressed to go on \r\n You'll be sorry when I'm gone \r\n \r\n I never conquered, rarely came \r\n Sixteen just held such better days 

 Never gonna give you up \r\n Never gonna let you down \r\n Never gonna run around and desert you \r\n \r\n Never gonna make you cry \r\n Never gonna say goodbye \r\n Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
 You take off your clothes \r\n And my heart feels the weight of all I don't know \r\n \r\n ;_; 
 Alguém me mostre como sorrir \r\n Até parece uma conspiração para eu desistir \r\n Não busco paz ja sei que é utopia \r\n Me tornar otimista até parece uma fantasia

 What goes around, goes around, goes around \r\n Comes all the way back around \r\n What goes around, goes around, goes around \r\n Comes all the way back around \r\n What goes around, goes around, goes around \r\n Comes all the way back around \r\n What goes around, goes around, goes around \r\n Comes all the way back around, yeah.
 Sometimes a man gets carried away, \r\n When he feels like he should be having his fun \r\n Much too blind to see the damage he's done \r\n \r\n Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really, he has no one

 Don't waste your time on me \r\n You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) 
 That time will tell that this was real enough for me
 In a little while from now \r\n If I'm not feeling any less sour \r\n I promise myself to treat myself \r\n And visit a nearby tower \r\n And climbing to the top will throw myself off
 I know it's over \r\n And it never really began \r\n But in my heart it was so real \r\n And you even spoke to me, and said : \r\n 'If you're so funny \r\n Then why are you on your own tonight ? \r\n And if you're so clever \r\n Then why are you on your own tonight ? \r\n If you're so very entertaining \r\n Then why are you on your own tonight ? \r\n If you're so very good-looking \r\n Why do you sleep alone tonight ? \r\n I know… \r\n 'Cause tonight is just like any other night \r\n That's why you're on your own tonight \r\n With your triumphs and your charms \r\n While they're in each other's arms…' \r\n It's so easy to laugh \r\n It's so easy to hate \r\n It takes strength to be gentle and kind \r\n Over, over, over, over \r\n \r\n The Smiths é um dicionário de dor 
 EU VOU TE PEDIR DESCULPAS \r\n EU PROMETO AMOR EU TE JURO \r\n NÃO VOU GUARDAR PRA MIM \r\n PARA SEMPRE ESTE ORGULHO \r\n \r\n TUDO BEM EU ENTENDO \r\n EU SEI QUE O ERRO FOI MEU \r\n EU TE PEÇO MIL DESCULPAS \r\n DO SEU GAROTO ROMEU, VALEU! \r\n \r\n EU FAÇO TUDO QUE VOCÊ QUISER \r\n (ENTÃO ME LEVA PARA DAR UM ROLÉ \r\n EU QUERO DAR, EU QUERO DAR) \r\n CALMA QUE EU VOU TE LEVAR
 Abra a porta e saia \r\n Deixe a brisa te beijar o rosto \r\n Eu sei que eu quis dormir sem te perguntar \r\n 'Você vai voltar?' \r\n \r\n Você me diz que o tempo te levará a esquecer dos outros \r\n E a morte te faz pensar em viver de novo
