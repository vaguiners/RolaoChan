I think sometimes it's better to write about something you're interested in rather than posting it without giving a reason. I'll also usually leave out one or two shows that I hate at first sight, but then enjoy later on. That's how I've been working on my own shows, even if it's not for the love of them anymore. \r\n \r\n How has the writing process gone for you?

 A woman with penis is better than a woman with vagina because in a natural vagina, there are no male reproductive organs, so no penis. Men are better than that, because men can be sexual creatures and not need a vagina, although we do all want to have vaginas. There are no female reproductive organs, so no uterus, because there will always be sperm or ovum. \r\n \r\n This means that any woman is an evolutionary improvement over her male counterpart. A woman who has a vagina is not an improvement at all over a man who has a penis that needs no vaginas. Therefore she is a sexist. \r\n \r\n I am not saying that I want a woman who is able to procreate. I am saying that we think it is not worth doing, if we are the ones who will be able to do it. No one denies that women have the potential to procreate because of evolution. However because we cannot, we believe it is not our job to give birth to women who will

 Hitler did not wrong, but he did his own best to make life bearable for the Jewish masses by putting on a 'kosher uniform' and by teaching Jewish kids things about them that Jews would do well to learn. Hitler also taught Jewish kids, but only of course by means of a Zionist propaganda program on television; he never taught anything about the Holocaust in-depth. What could possibly have been better for all of these things? For instance, by the late 1940s, when the SS was in good shape and was the largest and most powerful military force in the world, a small group of German soldiers decided to take on an entire village of Jews in the middle of nowhere. They shot the entire population (and more than two hundred children!) to death. It's difficult to imagine many Jews today who would think Hitler should have been praised as a hero for doing what his soldiers did, but that's exactly what happened with this Jewish village in the middle of the
