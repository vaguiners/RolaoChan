 I've never felt like… so miserable. \r\n I've never felt like thinking this will last for ever. \r\n Baby, stay with me. You gotta tell now, your love came all over me. \r\n When stars smile at Moon, wonder how look in your eyes. Just dialing your number, failing to press the last two. Praying the heart… \r\n When the Moon's reaching stars, if you hold me tigh, feeling heartbeat so close. Will this last long?
