senhores. \r\n \r\n proponho uma nova raid, desta vez na sala de suporte online da linksys(como já ocorrido em outros chans). \r\n postarei exemplos, for the lulz. \r\n

 Anna Marie Zamora (19603): Hi, my name is Anna Marie Zamora (19603). How may I help you? \r\n Mark Gil (20386): Hello, how are you? \r\n Anna Marie Zamora (19603): I am good Mark. Can you please confirm the model number of your Linksys product? \r\n Mark Gil (20386): Are you rex enough for tech support? \r\n Mark Gil (20386): Are YOU rex enough for tech support? \r\n Anna Marie Zamora (19603): I beg your pardon? \r\n Anna Marie Zamora (19603): What do you mean by that? \r\n Mark Gil (20386): Don't play stupid with me, you know damn well what I mean \r\n Anna Marie Zamora (19603): Since you don't have any Linksys devices that you want to configure, I will disconnect this chat session now since there are lots of clients on queue that we need to support. \r\n Anna Marie Zamora (19603): Have a great day! Bye. \r\n Anna Marie Zamora (19603) Has Disconnected \r\n \r\n PROTIP: rex = empregado despedido da linksys depois da primeira raid no 4chan, por insultar um anon após a pegadinha. THE MODS ARE WATCHING. \r\n
