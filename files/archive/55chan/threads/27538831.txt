 Survivors de Alison Chablez, a canção que (((eles))) não querem que você escute (parte 1). \r\n \r\n 1. My name is Irene Zisblatt \r\n And I come from Hungary \r\n Can you believe what evil Nazi bastards did to me? \r\n They gassed me once, they gassed me twice \r\n But escape I did \r\n Over the electric fence \r\n Landed on the train \r\n \r\n I saw them taking babies \r\n And then tearing them in two \r\n The creepy Dr Mengele, he removed my tattoo \r\n They tried to turn my brown eyes blue \r\n Make lampshades from my skin \r\n For months I swallowed diamonds \r\n And shat them out again \r\n \r\n REFRAIN: \r\n Come on, my brother \r\n Tell us another story \r\n For cover of tribal gain \r\n Safe in our tower \r\n Now is the hour \r\n Money and power \r\n We have no shame \r\n \r\n Let's cheat and lie on film \r\n No one suspects a thing \r\n Bigger the lie is better for us! \r\n \r\n Every fake survivor \r\n Every fake survivor's laughing \r\n Fake survivors' tongues are wagging \r\n All us frauds are busy blagging \r\n Spin and yarn, there'll be no gagging \r\n \r\n You shall pay \r\n All the way \r\n Every night and day! \r\n \r\n … \r\n \r\n 2. My name is Elie Wiesel \r\n May I show you my tattoo \r\n (Uuhh – where's it gone?) \r\n I wrote a book for US kids to study while at school \r\n It's full of nonsense tales, of course \r\n What did you all expect? \r\n But it made me very wealthy \r\n As a liar I'm the best \r\n \r\n At Auschwitz they burned babies \r\n Tho the water table's high \r\n Fred Leuchter's work on ditches \r\n It made me almost cry \r\n Treblinka was a another one \r\n There was no funeral pyre \r\n And I cannot speak Hungarian \r\n But, oh boy, can I lie \r\n \r\n REFRAIN: \r\n Tell us another \r\n Come on, my brother \r\n Repeat the cover \r\n For tribal gain \r\n \r\n Safe in our tower \r\n Now is the hour \r\n Money and power \r\n We have no shame \r\n \r\n History repeats itself \r\n No limits to our wealth \r\n Thanks to your debts we're bleeding you dry \r\n \r\n We control your media \r\n Control all your books and TV \r\n With the daily lies we feed you \r\n Suffering victimisation \r\n Sheeple have no realisation \r\n \r\n You shall pay \r\n All the way \r\n Until the break of day!

My name is Otto Frank \r\n And my daughter's name is Anne \r\n The poor girl died of typhus \r\n At Bergen-Belsen camp \r\n \r\n She wrote an introduction \r\n To her famous diary \r\n But the rest was penned by Levin \r\n And then published by me \r\n Two thousand and sixteen \r\n The copyright came to an end \r\n \r\n The Anne Frank trust decided \r\n Once again the rules to bend \r\n We truly had no choice although \r\n The whole thing really stank \r\n But the book now has two authors \r\n Yes, that's Anne and Otto Frank \r\n \r\n REFRAIN: \r\n Tell me another \r\n Come on, my brother \r\n Repeat the cover \r\n For tribal gain \r\n \r\n Safe in our tower \r\n Now is the hour \r\n Money and power \r\n We have no shame \r\n \r\n Bank notes: let's print some more \r\n We love to see you poor \r\n Let's start a war \r\n Our pockets to line \r\n There is no more doubting \r\n Every nation's debt is mounting \r\n While the bankers keep on counting \r\n Pension fund has now gone awol \r\n Nothing left upon your table \r\n \r\n You must pay \r\n Night and day \r\n Until the end of time!
