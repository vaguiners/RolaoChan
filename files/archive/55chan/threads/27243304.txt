 Deus, perdoe os anônimos desse site chamado de 55chan, pai, perdoa-lhes, porque não sabem o que fazem. Eu repreendo em nome de Jesus Cristo, tudo de ruim que existe no coração dos meus irmãos. Que Deus seja glorificado em todos os lugares do mundo! O chan agora é dos cristãos!
 Amém.

 The very word 'Christianity' is a misunderstanding — in truth, there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. \r\n This has commonly been paraphrased: The last Christian died on the cross. \r\n Sec. 39 \r\n As an artistic triumph in psychological corruption … the Gospels, in fact, stand alone … Here we are among Jews: this is the first thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the matter. This positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal 'holiness' unmatched anywhere else, either in books or by men; this elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an art — all this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual, or to any violation of nature. The thing responsible is race. \r\n Sec. 44 \r\n The whole disaster was only made possible by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar megalomania, allied to this one in race, to wit, the Jewish. \r\n Sec. 44 \r\n What follows, then? That one had better put on gloves before reading the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very advisable. One would as little choose early Christians for companions as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them — neither has a pleasant smell. \r\n Sec. 46 \r\n 'Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only one solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor. To take a Jewish affair seriously — he cannot persuade himself to do that. One Jew more or less — what does it matter ?… The noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on has enriched the New Testament with the only expression which possesses value — which is its criticism, its annihilation even: 'What is truth?…' \r\n Sec. 46 \r\n The God that Paul invented for himself, a God who 'reduced to absurdity' 'the wisdom of this world' (especially the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine), is in truth only an indication of Paul's resolute determination to accomplish that very thing himself: to give one's own will the name of God, Torah — that is essentially Jewish. \r\n Sec. 47 \r\n God created woman. And boredom did indeed cease from that moment — but many other things ceased as well! Woman was God's second mistake. \r\n Sec. 48 \r\n Gegen die Langeweile kämpfen Götter selbst vergebens. \r\n Against boredom even gods struggle in vain. \r\n Sec. 48 \r\n That faith makes blessed under certain circumstances, that blessedness does not make of a fixed idea a true idea, that faith moves no mountains but puts mountains where there are none: a quick walk through a madhouse enlightens one sufficiently about this. \r\n Sec. 51; often paraphrased as: 'A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything'. \r\n »Glaube« heißt Nicht-wissen-wollen. \r\n 'Faith' means not wanting to know. \r\n Sec. 52 \r\n Whom do I hate most among the rabble of today? The socialist rabble, the chandala apostles, who undermine the instinct, the pleasure, the worker’s sense of satisfaction with his small existence–who make him envious, who teach him revenge. The source of wrong is never unequal rights but the claim of “equal” rights. \r\n Sec. 57
 Ser cristão no chan é a maior das hipocrisias!
