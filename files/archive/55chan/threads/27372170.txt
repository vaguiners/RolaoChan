 The forest man has never been afraid of hard work \r\n Said the guy jerking the frame saw. \r\n No river has been able to throw \r\n This guy off his log. \r\n \r\n The work of a forest man is tough, \r\n Chopping down and pruning by muscle power. \r\n Carrying and piling up by shoulders. \r\n Hungry and cold but the forest is the home, \r\n Which feeds it's guys and keeps them warm \r\n \r\n The frame saw sings and the two-man saw grinds \r\n Said the guy with worn-out hands. \r\n The frame saw sings and the two-man saw grinds \r\n Said the guy with worn-out hands.
