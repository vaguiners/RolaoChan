 'What would you like to tell people?' \r\n \r\n 'I don’t know… I think I’d like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to be spend time with oneself. That doesn’t mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldn’t grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view.'

 The flies are angry bits of life; why are they so angry? \r\n it seems they want more,it seems almost as if they \r\n are angry that they are flies; \r\n I sit and watch the small one; \r\n we are woven together in the air \r\n and the living; it is late \r\n for both of us.
 There’s no chance at all: \r\n \r\n The city dumps fill, \r\n the junkyards fill, \r\n the madhouses fill, \r\n the hospitals fill, \r\n the graveyards fill, \r\n nothing else \r\n fills.
