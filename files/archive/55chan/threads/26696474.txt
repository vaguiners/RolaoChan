 But this light Is not for those men \r\n Still lost in An old black shadow \r\n Won't you help me to believe \r\n That they will see \r\n A day \r\n A brighter day \r\n When all the shadows \r\n Will fade away \r\n That day I'll cry \r\n That I believe \r\n That I believe

 Verdadeiro feij√£o humano.
